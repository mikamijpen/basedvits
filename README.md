# VITS Voice Conversion
This repo will guide you to add your voice into an existing VITS TTS model
to make it a high-quality voice converter to all existing character voices in the model.  

Welcome to play around with the base model, a Trilingual Anime VITS!

## Fine-tuning
It's recommended to perform fine-tuning on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1omMhfYKrAAQ7a6zOCsyqpla-wU-QyfZn?usp=sharing)
because the original VITS has some dependencies that are difficult to configure.

### How long does it take?
1. Install dependencies (2 min)
2. Record at least 10 your own voice (5 min)
3. Fine-tune (30 min)

## Inference or Usage

1. Install Python if you haven't done so (Python >= 3.7)
2. Clone this repo:  
`git clone https://github.com/SongtingLiu/VITS_voice_conversion.git`
3. Install dependencies  
`pip install -r requirements_infer.txt`
4. run VC_inference.py  
`python VC_inference.py`
